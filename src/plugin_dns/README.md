# DNS plugin

The DNS plugin is used to update a target DNS server with application route specific configuration. This allows for application specific DNS records rather than using wildcard dns records for resolution. 

## Testing Locally

In addition to the instructions part of the top-level README, please add the following `plugin_dns` specific parameters.

- A "nsupdate" enabled DNS server, such as `named`
- A valid nsupdate key that allows for add/delete of DNS records on the target DNS server

*Note* that if the DNS server targeted is not part of the regular resolver chain, you may override the resolvers with a custom resolv.conf by supplying the `resolv_conf` configuration option. This is needed in case you want to test with a zone that is not part of the normal resolvers or for some other reason this plugin cannot obtain the SOA information for the targeted zone through the normal DNS servers. In that event, just copy your current resolv.conf to a new location and ensure it has at least one valid `nameserver` entry in it (e.g.: the dns_server).

```
cat ~/myresolv.conf
nameserver 192.168.1.10
```

Once the above requirements are met, and the below listed configuration has been populated, updates to routes in OpenShift will be pushed to the DNS server.
